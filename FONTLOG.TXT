Basic Font Information

Bellota is an ornamented, low contrast sans-serif. It’s just cute enough!

It comes in six variations: regular, italic, light, light italic, bold & bold italic. It has stylistic alternates (for swash and non-ornamented characters) and ligatures available through opentype features.
Stylistic Style1: Swash Caps
Stylistic Style 2: Text

Bellota is based on the font "Snippet" by Gesine Todt (www.gesine-todt.de)
