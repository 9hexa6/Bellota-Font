==============================
![Bellota cover](http://www.pixilate.com/roots/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bellota1.png)

Bellota is an ornamented, low contrast sans-serif. It’s just cute enough!

Based on the font “Snippet” by Gesine Todt, it comes in six variations: regular, italic, light, light italic, bold & bold italic. It has stylistic alternates (for swash and non-ornamented characters) and ligatures available through opentype features. It supports most latin languages.
